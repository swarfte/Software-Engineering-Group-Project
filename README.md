# Software-Engineering-Group-Project

## software process

> In this project, we use the agile development process, the following reason will explain why we choose this method. The first reason is agile development is more flexible for develop. It is not necessary to follow the strict process, we can change the process according to the actual situation. In the current rapidly changing market, the agile development process can adapt to the market changes more quickly. The second reason is agile development is more suitable for the project with a short development cycle. for our project, we only have four team member and a month to implement the project, so we need to choose a development process that can be completed in a short time.
> in our development process, in the first place, we need to consider

Prerequisite: Tkinter, ttkbootstrap

Tkinter

> Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Creating the Frames

- Adding the Display Labels
- Adding the Digit Buttons & Operator Buttons
- Adding Functionality to the Buttons
- Handling Exceptions (like show the Error messages)

## algorithm

> Trigonometric functions( sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant cosecant); Exponents; Roots; Logarithms; addition; subtraction; multiplication; division; absolute value; reciprocal; factorial;

> before we build our project, we need to consider the main direction of the project and the risk of this direction.

## shedule

> ttkbootstrap is a collection of modern, flat themes inspired by Bootstrap for tkinter/ttk. Using this tool can develop tkinter desktop programs similar to the front-end bootstrap style.

## future plan

> At this stage, we have finished the basic function of the calculator,such as arithmetic, log, trigonometric function and so on. We will add more function in the future, such as matrix , calculus and so on. in addition, we also intend to add some auxiliary tools , for example, the record function for user to record the calculation process, the help function for user to get the help information and so on. In future , we consider to develop a function that let user write a script by themselves and then the calculator can run it step by step to get the result, which is similar to the function of the matlab.

## additional coponent

> we use python to build the project , base on the tkinter and ttkbootstrap library , the project implement the cross-platform running. So most mainstream operating systems can run the project smoothly , such as windows, linux, macos and so on. the following operating system has been tested and can run the project : Windows 11 , Windows 10 , Windows 7 , Ubuntu 22.04 , Ubuntu 20.04, Linux Mint 21 , Linux Mint 20.
